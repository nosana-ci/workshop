This repository houses Nosana workshops.
Each workshop focuses on a specific use case to help participants become aquainted with the Nosana tool suite.

This repository is designed to aid in live Nosana workshops, but each assignment should be self-explanatory and doable with just the documentation.

The [assignments](./assignments) directory contains the various workshops.
